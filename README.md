# Berlin Airbnb Open Data

### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings in Berlin, Germany, to uncover key insights about the city's short-term rental market. The analysis explores various aspects such as the distribution of room types, booking trends, income generation, and host behaviors.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/) and was published on 22 June, 2024. It includes data on listings, reviews, and booking calendars. The final analysis, inspired by the Inside Airbnb dashboard, is compiled in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes all necessary code, visualizations, and findings.

### File Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- Berlin Airbnb Open Data.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.
- Data/: Folder containing the raw dataset used in the analysis:
  - listings.csv: Includes full descriptions of Airbnb listings, along with average review scores.
  - calendar.csv: Contains information on listing availability and pricing on a daily basis (needs to be downloaded separately, refer to the Instructions section).
  - reviews.csv: Contains unique reviewer IDs and detailed comments on the listings (needs to be downloaded separately, refer to the Instructions section).
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and its structure.

### Instructions
The Jupyter Notebook (Berlin Airbnb Open Data.ipynb) contains everything required to re-do the analysis, including loading the necessary libraries, processing the data, performing the analysis, and generating the visualizations. Please note that the files calendar.csv and reviews.csv need to be downloaded separately from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) due to their large size and GitHub restrictions.
